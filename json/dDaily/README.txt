if you're reading this, then there's a 99% chance that you're somebody that i sent this page to, which means there's a 99% chance you're somebody i know
i appreciate the fact that you're visiting this site (since you have to be in order to be reading this), so i figured id give you some context for what this is
as im writing this, i decided like 15 minutes ago that id start keeping a personal diary in order to reflect and do whatever i feel like every day, and give myself something to compare myself against in the future
i figured that i should probably host it somewhere in case anything happens to me/my computer, so i picked this site since everything was already set up
however, as you know, this is all public now
i would appreciate it if you **didn't** tell me that you found this so that i can safely pretend that nobody ever besides me is reading this, though, of course, im comfortable enough with the idea of other people reading this for me to be hosting it here
so yeah. ill be keeping everything sufficiently vague to a) keep myself from getting bogged in details and b) give myself a small safety net in case anyone does read this
maybe ill put some secret codes or something at some point (since secret codes are cool)

tl;dr daily diary, read if you want but dont tell me, there wont be anything incriminating in here as ill be keeping things vague. enjoy
