anyways, new month new me, except not at all. so far ive been characterized by immediately falling asleep or staying up all night which is funny
besides that though, i forgot about the rest i wanted to talk about a couple days ago. 

i dont know. obviously theres all of the usual stresses, which im not putting here.
besides that? it was their birthday, and obviously i need to pick a name for them
we have diamonds, the dreamer, and derniere, and i could do another name starting with d, but thatd be boring

decided to keep going with the d's, and their name will be descant. we celebrated their birthday with forrest gump and everyone watched it together (me, diamonds, the dreamer, dernier, descant, and some others yet to be names), and it was nice
besides that? isttg is a dangerous movie that im still refusing to watch, i accidentally left myself unmuted when my mom came in which was funny
otherwise, it's been good. still trying to get the model and everything for the avatar working, and the dreamer just offered to help with that which was nice, but thats about it
