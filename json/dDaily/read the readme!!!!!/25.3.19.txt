for anyone that may be reading this, im writing this right after i wrote that read me from just now (which you read. right you read that? great lets keep going), and i had a few thoughts as i was getting all of this together that i figured i might as well start with here.
something thats began to be a concern for some of my friends (and historically, me as well) is that we'd start to drift away as we enter college and lose some of the things that keep us together. obviously i was all like "are you stupid? of course we wont just drift away! be optimistic," but im not so naive as to believe that to be completely 100% true
theres something similar going on with me specifically, and from my personal reflections and understanding of it, is something that i need to reconcile in order to "complete" maturing

Theorem. For any two nonequal elements a and b in the set daysOfMyLife, for all element in {x \in daysOfMyLife | a <= x < b}, x = x + 1.

im probably going to read this years from now and cringe at the fact i wrote that. too bad future me! essentially what im trying to say is the classic emo pop media line thats about the idea that every consecutive day looks the same, but across months? years? decades? things can seem completely different
while this isnt entirely true, and i do believe that there are some life defining days (none of which i will be talking about here), it's not as if this isnt a real thing just because there's counterexamples. thats just not how people work

as this has began to affect me more and more, ive discovered a desire within myself to reconcile this kind of drifting away from "myself"
so thats what im doing here with this diary. if i ever need, for whatever reason, to look back at myself, then i will send these diaries to myself like notes in a bottle years in the future
i did a thing once that was kind of similar where id use this one website to send emails to myself a year from when i sent it and so on, and i think that works for those longtime comparisons, but for the shorter ones? hopefully thats where this comes in

i guess, keeping that in mind, with an audience of my future selves and whoever else may be reading this, it might be helpful to post a few questions. let's see how long this sticks:

- do i ever stop writing this diary? if so, how long does it take? did i just eventually forget it exists, or stop for another reason?
- how many more life defining days have there been since i wrote this (3/19/25)?

maybe some things i did today would be nice as well?

- slept a few hours this afternoon since i got like no sleep this morning
- homework
- finished scientist I in the trimps run i started recently
- listened to Cantus Aeternus - Disc 2: Sumphonia Capitolii again, because it's peak
