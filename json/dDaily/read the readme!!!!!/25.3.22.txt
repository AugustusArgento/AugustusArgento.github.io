im writing this at 2am because earlier today i told myself id write this later, then it was later and i forgot, and now it's even more later and im only just remembering
anyways, today was characterized by yesterday. i decided for some mix of unknown reasons that id stop sending anything on discord until some arbitrary date (though it's not as if i stopped being active on other platforms)
but i kept thinking about this one comic i found some time back, and it hasnt been able to escape my mind for days now

it's essentially about this feeling of lost jade (from homestuck) feels after she leads herself to - wrongly - believe that her friends had abandoned her
she didnt know that they died because of mysterious plot things one of her friends from a timeline that never existed did, but it couldntve mattered any less to her in the moment
though she did nothing wrong, she is forced to live on a ship flying through space without any of her friends from the years 13 through 16

think about it for a moment - she had grown up entirely isolated her whole life, the only other human she had seen in person being the dead corpse of her grandpa
her entire life being predestinated to play one game with her friends, and on that day, she's constantly passing out and falling asleep, feeling swept to the wayside of everything thats going on
and after that one day? it's those years of loneliness all over again, but now even worse as the one thing she found solace in is ripped away from her

and, spoilers, it doesnt get better for her after that. she's possessed and manipulated to only do tasks that others want to be done, removed of any and all possible agency
in the last remaining timeline of the story? she doesnt even get to hear the voice of one of her closest friends.

- i reread jade's pov in homestuck up to around 3000, for reasons you can probably guess
- homework galore!
- thought of a nice username, if you're me you can find it at https://discord.com/channels/1260827539400818749/1263210034553159730/1353291147652370465
- i need to ask diamonds about a part of it, since theyve studied it and i havent, but the aforementioned me-talking ban is still up, so, what can you do
- of course, id need to be able to tell the diamonds about the name in the first place, and you and i both know thats not happening any time soon
