it took barely any time for my embargo to be broken, and i couldnt help but find myself joining the call again tonight
i made up a half-lie about how we had by traveling and i was unable to contact them for a while, which isnt entirely false, but that trip isnt happening for another couple of days



anyways, i left this half finished last night because i got distracted
i wasnt, however, the most sure of what i was going to write about, so we didnt miss out on too much, i suppose
lets just call yesterday's log done, and ill write tonight's later
