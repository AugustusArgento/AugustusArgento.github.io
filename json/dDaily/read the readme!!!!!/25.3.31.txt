you may have noticed that it's been a week since the last one, and if you know me then you know why. and if you dont - why are you here?
to be fair, though, ill probably forget in the future, so ill just say that i went to an adjacent state for some days

i got back yesterday, and on the trip i did think about a few things. obviously there was more jade harley angsting, but the time to think was helpful
for today, i guess, one think i should probably talk about is the way i do everything. and yes, thats a frustratingly vague topic, but thats kind of the point
i feel as if im somehow enamoured by the idea of my self being some kind of puzzle, that in order to figure things out, people need to put in effort to find the truth
after all, thats why im hiding this in my basically abandoned website's github. who in their right mind is ever going to come here? but if i need people to read this, then thats what theyll have to do

i think i talked about in a previous day about how i stopped talking, and while i dont remember what i said, i do know the real reason why
though for reasons i just talked about, i dont know if i want to get into that already. theres only a handful of logs here so far, read further and maybe ill talk about it in the future
though i guess im making it into a puzzle again, so i might as well just say it now.
im afraid that by reaching out, im just giving an opportunity for them to forget me again

obviously ive talked talked about diamonds already, and we know theyre great. 
but for the longest time, and even still now, it's just me talking to them and hardly ever them reaching out to me
in the nights when we've actually talked to each other, it felt like it was just me dumping to them, with hardly anything else from diamonds
and it's not as if i want to force them to say something they dont want to, but at the same time i want to know them

as i keep writing here, i keep thinking of more things i want to say, but this is already getting pretty long. maybe just one more thing

i know that a lot of what im thinking about here couldnt be more mundane - when i share something to a friend and they dont respond until i mention it in a call later, or i ask someone a question and it feels like they just ignore it
and it's not as if i want to be more forceful about what i say, or whatever. but it feels like ive been doing the same thing for years with nothing changing
so much of it is just the most trivial thing. does it hit so hard because i think about it so much? because it just hits me more for whatever reason? who knows!
