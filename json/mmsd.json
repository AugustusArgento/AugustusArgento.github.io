None of them are perhaps more valuable or unique than the panels of the Amber Room, dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World. Gifted to Russian czar Peter the Great in 1716 by Friedrich I, the king of Prussia, to seal a Russian-Prussian alliance against Sweden, the panels were intricate works of fine amber and gold, intended to coat every surface of a room in golden opulence. German officers allegedly crated up the panels and sent them into hiding, though some believe the panels were destroyed by bombs. In either case, the magnificent Amber Room panels have never been seen since."

Interestingly, it is information from the so-called Black Sox, the members of the infamous Chicago White Sox team who were proven to have intentionally thrown the 1919 World Series in exchange for money, that lends this mystery plausibility. Specifically, Black Sox member Eddie Cicotte said curing a 1920 court deposition that a \"number of Cubs\" were each offered $10,000 to intentionally lose their championship the previous year, and though such allegations have haunted baseball for years, sports historians say that it is entirely possible that the players, who were famously underpaid at the time, may have indeed taken money in exchange for losing against the Red Sox."

While Southern  Television's news anchor, Andrew Gardner, was cruising through the night's standard headlines and news items, viewers saw a small waver on the channel's visual before all audio was suddenly cut off. What followed has gone down in pop history as a particularly amusing mystery. A voice came over the channel, claiming to be \"Vrillon,\" a representative of the \"Ashtar Galactic Command.\" While television technicians scrambled to regain control of their station, \"Vrillon\" told listening viewers that his people were an ancient race of space farers and that, having watched over Earth for many years, they were announcing to its peoples that they must cease all violence in order to partake in a great \"galactic awakening.\" Shortly thereafter, the strange transmission ended, and the channel returned to its normal programming. While very few believe in the existence of Vrillon or the Ashtar Galactic Command, no one knows to this day who perpetrated the broadcast stunt and how they did so, given the decade's relatively limited technology."

Closely resembling Earth in terms of mass and radius, its surface reaches up to two thousand degrees hotter than Earth's, because it orbits Kepler-78 at an incredibly close range and completes an entire orbit in less than nine hours. Scientists report that Kepler-78b should not exist, and how the planet formed and ended up so close to its star remains a mystery. Experts claim there is no physical way the planet could have formed in that location, stating that when the planet was forming, it would have been larger than it is currently. Mathematically speaking, it would have had to have been orbiting from inside the star, which is impossible. Scientists are still collecting more data on the planet to hopefully learn how it was formed under such seemingly impossible conditions."

Considering the United States' tense relationship with the Soviet Union at the time and the fact that she had a Russian-looking headscarf on, authorities and the public alike started speculating on her possible involvement in the assassination. Her behavior was questionable on tape; she appeared to stay in one place as everyone around her ran for cover following the shots being fired. Some argue her stature is closer to a man's and that she could have possible been a Russian spy, sent to the States to oust the U.S. president. Although authorities have made many efforts to locate her, her identify remains a mystery."

Although the planet is well known to be pocked and pitted with craters left behind my meteorite impacts, ancient floods, and volcanic activity, none so far have matched the sheer size of the one discovered my the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2017. So far, NASA scientists have admitted that they cannot say for certain what caused such a large geographical feature to form on the red planet's surface, but they theorize that anything from an unusually large meteor or perhaps a collapse of the surface's structure itself could be to blame."

Since his death in 1819, however, many have wondered about the final resting place of Hawaii's first official king, with many suggesting wildly competing theories about where his bones may have been laid. Most agree that Kamehameha's lieutenants, named Ho'olulu and Hoapili, prepared the king's body and interred him in a sacred burial cave hidden somewhere on the islands, where only the most respected chiefs and holy figures were laid to rest. Others argue that Kamehameha's bones are hidden somewhere on the grounds of the royal palace in Maui, which has held the remains of almost all royalty since King Kamehameha II held power in 1837. A scarce few even believe that the king rests deep under the palace in a grotto protected by Kihawahine, a dragon goddess. Regardless, almost all agree that, in accordance with the Hawaiian proverb \"the morning star alone knows where Kamehameha's bones are guarded,\" the mystery should forever stand unbroken out of respect for the great king."

        "content": "Edward Teach -- also known as \"Blackbeard\" for his long, braded beard -- was one of the most well-known pirates in history. His most dramatic act of piracy, stealing one of the largest warships, La Concorde, from French slave traders in 1717, led him to an area off the coast of Martinique in the Caribbean. The ship was carrying crew, slaves, and twenty pounds of gold dust. Blackbeard promptly unloaded all the people and kept the treasure aboard. As he sailed around the Caribbean, Blackbeard collected a small following of fellow pirates, and the group blockaded a large port in Charleston, South Carolina, to seize medical supplies from the area. After receiving the supplies, the group traveled to North Carolina, where they had several hiding spots for their vessels. When they tried to advance on Beaufort, North Carolina, the ship, which Blackbeard renamed Queen Anne's Revenge, ran aground. The crew were mostly unharmed and able to unload the treasures. This detail leads historians to believe Blackbeard had time to stow away his loot well before his death in 1718, but no one knows where the famed pirate's treasure is buried."

The poem, believed to have been written sometime between the seventh and eighth centuries, has been translated into dozens of languages, adapted into epic movies and stories, and remains popular to this day. However, one large piece of the story's history remains a mystery: its author. It has been attributed only to an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet, and historians have yet to discover the author's identity in the centuries since the writing of Beowulf. Scholars note that details of the epic poem are linked to history, such as the Danish king Hrothgar, the feasting hall described in the story, and perhaps, some think, even Beowulf himself. Historians believe the the story of his exploits was most likely brought to England by Scandinavian settlers in the sixth or early seventh century. Where the epic poem originated or if multiple authors were involved in its telling, however, remains a mystery."

Samuel \"Black Sam\" Bellamy was a prolific pirate, feared far and wide in the early eighteenth century and well known for his love of wealth and the finer things. So great was this reputation that many attribute our modern view of pirates dressing in eccentric, lavish garments almost entirely to Bellamy. While this may or not be true, it is known beyond a doubt that following his voyages to pillage and steal, and pirate captain retreated to the bays of a town now known as Machias, where his ships sheltered in the Machias River's mouth while the captain and his crews divvied up their loot. To this day, historians believe that stores of gold and plunder are left to be found in the area, and any who might uncover Black Sam Bellamy's treasure would be rich beyond their wildest dreams."

Soon after their arrival, the team set to work ravaging Egypt's ancient structures with the goal of plundering their contents and returning them to England's museums, using methods such as gunpowder to reach their goals more quickly than other, more delicate researchers. The team was rewarded when they stumbled upon what they believed to be the tomb of Menkaure, and the transferred the pharaoh's sarcophagus to the English ship Beatrice. On its voyage back to England, however, the ship disappeared, never to be seen again. More interestingly, modern anthropologists say the stolen sarcophagus may not have even contained Menkaure but instead an unknown royal."

By the end of January that year, reports were released by the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center citing blunt-force trauma as the cause of the birds' death and specifically discounting the presence of chemicals or contaminants. While the study concretely explained the nature of the flock's demise, many wonder what spurred the furious assault on the town, with many dismissing the behavior as having been spurred by fireworks. Despite this, many residents of Beebe are firmed that the fireworks were neither loud enough nor near enough to where the birds nested to cause such a reaction and argue that some other, unknown force was to blame for the night's morbid events."

There, hundreds of British redcoats had marched in order to quell a rebellion of American colonists and seize the arms they had gathered. They found themselves faced by a mere seventy minutemen, and as tensions wore thin, the first shot was fired. By the time the smoke cleared, eight American soldiers had been killed, and one redcoat had been wounded. More importantly, however, the American Revolutionary War had officially begun. In the following months and years, that one shot grew into a pitched battle for the independence of what would become the United States of America. To this day, however, historians argue about who -- or even which side -- fired that first fateful shot outside Lexington and thus began the war."

Several citizens of Mattoon reported sudden onsets of nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, and even spitting up blood. All of those affected described a sickly sweet, perfume-like smell immediately before the illness came over them. It was this last detail that led authorities to suspect that the sicknesses were in fact crimes -- deliberate gassings by persons unknown, terrorizing the small town. Further investigation showed that most of the gassings had occurred on the month's hottest nights, when residents left their windows open against the hear. No suspect was ever found, despite public outcry, and attacks that continued throughout the month. Some historians argue that the gassings and illnesses were caused by a bout of mass hysteria, though many others agree that there indeed was a mystery gasses terrorizing Mattoon in 1944. No real evidence has ever been found of the person's identity or motive."

Medical experts say that FAS is usually a supplemental effect of a stroke, but it can also be a result of head trauma or even mental developmental issues. The syndrome was first documented in 1907. One of the most notable cases happened when a woman from Norway suddenly spoke with a German accent after a head injury; this led to her being shunned by her community during the German occupation of her home country during World War II. Experts say FAS can arise out of psychological trauma as well, making it harder to identify.

But contrary to what modern fans may think, the curveball did not originate at the same time as baseball itself, and the actual inventor of the pitch is something hotly disputed by sports historians. The National Baseball Hall of Fame attributes the inventor of the curveball to a man named Candy Cummings, who debuted in the league in 1876. Cummings is quoted as having imagined the pitch after watching a trajectory shell be thrown into the air to gauge the wind speed and direction, and the story goes that he immediately began practicing to see if he could emulate the shell's behavior with a baseball. Others, however, call foul on Cummings getting the credit and instead thank a man named Phonney Martin, whose curveball was so pronounced that many thought it to be an optical illusion, long before Cummings even laced up hit cleats in the major league. Though seemingly a minor thing to nonfans, the history of the curveball is hotly debated by hard-core baseball fans to this day."

Currect theories posit that a rushed embalming process may have caused the phenomenon and that oils used in the process may have reacted poorly with one another once the pharoah had already been enclosed in his sarcophagus, igniting his flesh and wrappings until the tomb's air supply had been consumed.

The \"termites\" had to burrow through thurty-one-inch cement walls from an underground cellar to gain access to vaults, where they held the security guard at gunpoint as they dumped out all the safety deposit boxes. Officials commented on the similarities in heist style to the infamous 1970s heist orchestrator Albert Spaggiari, the mastermind behind a massive heist in Nice, France, where he spent months digging a tunnel into a financial institution to steal millions.

        "content": "Serbian inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla, one of the most prolific thinkers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, is best known for inventing the alternating current induction motor. Just before his death in 1943, Tesla made public statements about a potential \"death beam\" weapon he had developed. Naturally, at the height of World War II, government officials all over the world were interested in his technology. Regardless, Tesla did not share any details about the invention, and when he died suddenly in a New York City hotel, many believed the documents explaining the new weapon were with him. Tesla's nephew, Yugoslavian ambassador Save Kosanovic, rushed to the hotel, but Tesla's body had been removed and his research was missing. Kosanovic was listed as Tesla's heir, and he fought with the U.S. government to relinquish his uncle's property to him. The FBI recorded taking about eighty trunks of Tesla's materials, but it sent only sixty back to Kosanovic. None that surfaced contained the coveted \"death beam\" technology, and the famous Tesla papers are still missing."

Romantic though that notion may be, historians say there is persuasive evidence that in the time leading up to his final battle, Custer was known to be carrying six months of back pay for his men in silver, gold, and bank notes, worth almost #25,000 dllars at the time, and much, much more in modern times. After his defeat and death at Little Bighorn, however, the treasure vanished, and the general consensus is that Native American warriors claimed and buried the chest of precious metals and U.S. Treasury notes on Sioux lands. Beyond this, however, no trace has yet been found, and though the scant survivors of the incident verified the existence of the treasure, none could offer any helpful clues to its potential whereabouts, and it remains lost to this day."

In the famous painting, a young woman's upper body is angled away from the viewer with her face turned toward them, a delicate pearl earring dangling from her left ear. For years, art historians have tried to identify the subject of Vermeer's most famous work. Her identity was never shared at the time of Vermeer's unveiling of the piece, and experts say her concealed identity was most likely intentional on Vermeer's part, who was noted as a very private artist of his time. The mystery of the girl is also highlighted by the composition of the painting, as she is set of a dark background with her mouth slightly open, as if she is about to speak. The piece has inspired millions of viewers around the world, as well as a best-selling novel and film adaptation, to speculate on the girl's story in the painting and what he true identity is, with Vermeer's daughter Maria being the leading contender."

The mound in Hamilton resembles a large serpent, with several curves winding back and forth that can be seen when observed from above. This particular effigy is the largest recorded serpent effigy on the planet. Since its modern discovery, historians and archaeologists have been trying to gather details about the mound regarding its development, use, and general history. However, unlike many other well-known effigies, the area around the Great Serpent Mound does not contain any cultural clues, such as burial sites or personal effects that would usually help to date the structure and identify its builders. Though researchers have hypotheses about indigenous peoples who might be linked to the mound, they lack evidence about who built the structure and why."

Regardless of the motive to remove his brain postmortem, the most mysterious aspect of the brain's removal is the fact that it went missing from the National Archives. Some theorize his brother Robert F. Kennedy secretly removed it to prevent any analyses that would reveal his brother's illnesses or how many medications he had been taking at the time of his death. Others believe the removal was orchestrated by the U.S. Government because the organ might reveal that the assassination did not occur as the history books say it did. According to records from a House Committee on Assassinations, the National Archives was aware the brain was missing but decided not to pursue its whereabouts after discerning through an investigation that the brain's misplacement was not due to their error.

After another few weeks, Roxas and his team discovered a three-foot golden Buddha weighing more than a ton, valued at over $22 billion, as well as various other precious items, soon after, President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines detained Roxas and seized Yamashita's treasure. Though legal battles between the two persisted until after Toas's death in 1993, many historians, inspired by Roxas's work, eventually calculated that he had discovered only one of the general's hiding places and that as many as eighting more such Buddhas may still be uncovered."

How a simple cottage grew to this gargantuan, convoluted estate is largely the result the efforts of one woman: Sarah Winchester, heiress to the firearms fortune bearing her name. Upon purchasing the home in 1884, Winchester hired relay teams of carpenters to work twenty-hour hours every day until she died in 1922, expanding the house in peculiar and unpredicatable ways, sometimes demolishing recently finished rooms to make way for new, stranger additions. Spy holes, trapdoors, and hidden passages dotted the mansion, some leading to rooms so obscure and well-hidden that they were only discovered long after he death.

There, Dolly Gray played only a single game, again demonstrating his utter lack of skill, and then vanished entirely on the day that the team was supposed to be boaring a train for an away game.

While at first the theory was met with healthy skepticism, over time, an increasing number of experts have grown to hesitantly agree with Bostrom. Put simply, the idea is that one of three possibilities exist: humans go extinct before possessing the technology to create such a simulation, humans reach suhc a point and have no interest in doing so, or we are living in such a simulation already. Importantly, many argue that so-called paradoxes in quantum physics could represent glitches in the simulation and that such a theory might explain several key mysteries about the nature of our universe that we are yet to understand."

Nazi officials claimed he escaped to South America, but Allied investigators did not believe he was successful. In 2013, German history professor Johannes Tuchel claimed to have tracked down his whereabouts to a Jewish cemetery that had been taken over by the Nazis, who used it as a mass grave site. However, Jewish law restricts the exhumation of remains, so the professor cannot certify his theory. Other historians refute his claims, stating it would be in incredibly bad taste for a Nazi leader to be buried among Jewish victims.

In 2000, other descriptions in different areas contradicted these accounts, claiming the monster was a quadruped. Experts believe the true culprits behind the livestock attacks are actually rabid dogs or coyotes that bite tha animals and leave them to die.

        "content": "The Yellowstone Caldera is a supervolcano found in Yellowstone National Park. When it last erupted about 2.1 million years ago, the volcano produced six thousand times the ejected material of the 1980 Mount St. Helens Eruption. The Yellowsotne Volcano Observatory, a group of nine state and federal agencies, is responsible for monitoring the supervolano's eruptions. If the volcano were to erupt, experts say the effects would ripple throughout the United States and most of the Western Hemisphere, spanning from major lava damage to catastrophic impact on air quality from falling ash. Scientists continue to uncover new facts about the supervolano's structure and destructive potential and claim that the chances of a large-scale eruption in the next few millennia are smil. Nonetheless, even experts admit that our ability to predict a future eruption is incomplete at best, leading many to wonder when the Yellowstone Caldera may next wake up. Some conspiracy theorists have alleged sightings of animals feleing area, which they claim is because they sense an upcoming eruption."

Those who live near the dunes have attributed their songs to everything from evil spirits to demons. Now, however, scientists say that they have confirmed that friction between individual grains of sand contributes to the songs, but they are still confounded by the precise conditions required for miniscule, individual grains of sand to produce the haunting songs written about by the likes of Morco Polo. A group of Parisian biophysicists has taken to the task and theorize that the size of the sand grains is likely the source of each sand dune's distinct pitch, but beyond that, they have failed to identify the exact requirements for making the sand sing."

Starting in 2011, researchers reported sighting the whales forming so-called supergroups. The groups, consisting of anywhere from twenty to two hundred of the animals, were largely sighted off the southwest coast of Africa, and experts say that no previous reports have mentioned such large gatherings. Additionally, scientists are at a loss to explain the location of the sightings, as humpback whales primarily feed near the southern region of Antarctica. One promising theory suggests that the behavior is a result of the whales experiencing a population boom since the 1960s, when whaling was banned by many nations, and that this type of supergrouping might have actually been the norm for humpbacks when they existed in greater numbers. For now, however, scientists continue to study the animals in hopes of unraveling their mysteries."

The vessel's lifeboat was missing, and the last log book recording was written six hours before. There was little damage to the ship, and it was operating sufficiently. Eventually, the abandoned ship was towed to a port and put out to sea gain. Some locals questioned if the crew and passengers were unused to the cold waters and had panicked after a small collision with a nearby iceberg. (The collision did not affect the ship's integrity or ability to float.) Perhaps they abandoned the ship out of fear and lost control of their lifeboat. However, there has never been any trace of the eleven people who were traveling aboard the vessel. More mysteriously, the skipper, John James, was said to have had his gold coin collection on board with him during the journey, and collection was not found on the abandoned ship, leaving many questioning if those valuables could have had something to do with the vessel's disappearance."

Described at first as slugh-like, the Tully monster is thought to have had a long, thin appendage tipped in claws where a mout would normally be, with protruding eye stalks. So strange is the fossil that scientists still hotly debate whether the creature was a vertebrate or invertebrate and how to classify it. Even after employing particle accelerator technology to examine the Tully monster's remains, the verdict is still out about the beast, but scientists can almost entirely agree that the creature stands as one of history's most enduring evolutionary mysteries."

Though the practice has since grown, with millions of viewers tuning in to experience the tingling sensation provoked by such sounds, very little scientific research has been conducted on how ASMR works. Recently, researchers from the University of Winnipeg implemented functional MRI technology to record the brain activity of people as they were exposed to ASMR. The study attempted to explain why some people react strongly to the sounds, experiencing a type of tingling sensation in their brain and nerves, while others show no reaction whatsoever. While ambitious, the research failed to unravel the mystery of ASMR, instead providing even more questions as to how it works. While future studies are planned to explore the subject, for now most are content to simply sit back, relax, and enjoy the mystery."

Experts believe the geoglyph was created in modern times, claiming local artists or even military members serving in the area could have been its originators. They say the orchestrators most likely used some type of GPS technology to create the massive artwork, and considering how new the technology was at the time, they say the accomplishment is remarkable. Interestingly, anonymous faxes were sent to local businesses alerting people of the artwork's location just before the pilot spotted it from the air. Although the faxes observe American spelling and some American materials were found near the location, officials believe the artist or artists were intentionally misleading people to withhold their identities.
